# ruby:  http://ruby-doc.org i like.  clean, not designed by a blind man
# would be perfect if i could pin the methods to the side, or had a old school 2 iframe mode
# for the columns.i wind up scrolling top to bottom constantly, otherwise perfect.
# rails: http://guides.rubyonrails.org is the best looking, but not really an API
# rails: http://api.rubyonrails.org works but is ugly as hell.
